Hello love, we’ve been together for three months now. Time really flies by with you in my life. It was as if just yesterday we were only strangers sitting in the same bar unaware of each other’s existence. Yet, for some unknown equation of the universe, our lives have been intertwined. Times have been hard, and time will be harder still. But I know waking up will be easier knowing you’re with me. Your love fuels my life with electricity I’ve never experienced before. Breathing new life to a love I’ve always had but never knowing who to give it to. I love you.
I hope soon we can lay by each other’s arms. I hope soon we can whisper our love for each other without the worries of what ifs. I hope soon we can shout our feelings, displayed for the world to see. I hope soon I can be with you.
Thank you for accepting me in your life. Thank you for allowing me to love you.
Forever loving, forever for you,
Mav
